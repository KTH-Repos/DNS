DNS Lab Skeleton Files
==============

This repository contains skeleton files for the DNS lab. The following
files are included:

* **named.conf** The main configuration file for named. You
  should edit this file to make changes to your domain, _but do not
  rename or remove the file._
* **db.empty** A skeleton zone file. When you want to
   create a new zone file, make a copy of this file, and edit the copy.
* **db.root** A zone file with all the root servers. This file is
essential for your name server to work correctly. Do not touch it.

Lab Submission
==========

You do the lab by cloning this repository. Make your changes by editing
the named config file and adding zone files. Commit your changes to
your local repository, and make sure to push the local repository
to the remote repository on KTH GitHub.
